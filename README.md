# Titanic Survival Prediction
This project is a solution for the Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster competition on Kaggle. The goal of the competition is to build a machine learning model that can predict which passengers survived the sinking of the Titanic based on various features such as age, sex, and class.

## Dataset
The dataset for this competition is provided by Kaggle and can be downloaded from the competition's data page. The dataset contains information about 891 passengers on board the Titanic, including whether they survived or not.

## The Neural Network I Designed
For this project, I built a neural network using TensorFlow to predict whether a given passenger survived the sinking of the Titanic. The neural network consists of three layers: two dense layers with 100 units and tanh activation functions, and a final dense layer with 1 unit and a sigmoid activation function. The model was trained using the Binary Crossentropy loss function and the Adam optimizer.

## Results
My neural network was able to achieve an accuracy of 75.837% on the test dataset, which puts me in the top 84% of participants in the Kaggle competition. This is one of my first attempts at building a neural network, and I'm excited to continue learning and improving my skills in this area.

## Conclusion
Overall, this was a great learning experience for me, and I enjoyed building and training the neural network to predict Titanic survival.
